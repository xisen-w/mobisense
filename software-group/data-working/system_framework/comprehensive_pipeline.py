This pipeline will take in the raw data and output the processed data for the system framework.

I want this to be native streamlit app. 

It integrates all the existing methods and functions of calculations.

This pipeline will have the following parts:

1. Data loading (Sending the data of IMU)
2. Data Visualisation (Plotting the data out, the angles and the raw data) 

2. Data preprocessing
3. Feature extraction & Calculation (All the metrics)
4. Feature Visualisation 
6. Result saving
